# About

We are hosting the Thailand chapter of the annual Hacktoberfest event, a global open-source contribution challenge held each year in October to introduce and incentivize people to contribute to open-source software.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will be hosting the offline event with limited capacity while simultaneously hosting the virtual meet up along with other Hacktoberfest events around the world.

We're thrilled to present exclusive talks and workshop sessions from open-source contributors to share this exciting experience with you.

We are participating with multiple local agencies, corporate entities, and communities involved in open source projects that are non-profit or beneficial to society. Together, we will collaborate and contribute actively to this event, so please stay tuned and get in touch for more details.

DigitalOcean and DEV is the host of the global Hacktoberfest challenge, while BRIKL and Seven Peaks hosts this local chapter.
