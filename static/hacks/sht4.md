# About

Following the tremendous success of The Stupid Hackathon Thailand #3, we are coming back to The Stupid Hackathon Thailand #4!

**The Stupid Hackathon Thailand** is a collaborative hackathon in Thailand with no competition or focuses on business value whatsoever.

Our main goal for this hackathon is to get developers to just _have fun_ and learn together, through working on any project they can dream of, fostering a community of enthusiastic makers.

The stupid hackathon is [held all around the world](https://gist.github.com/cheeaun/c3fe6cbb11aef1e146a3474dccf63b87), including New York (the original), San Francisco, Rhode Island, Canada, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Hawaii, UK, Shanghai, Singapore, and… here, Thailand! In the spirit of the stupid hackathons worldwide, this event is _non-commercial_ and free to attend.
