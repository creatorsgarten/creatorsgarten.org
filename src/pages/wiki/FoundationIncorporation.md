title: Foundation Incorporation
---

Currently when it comes to dealing with monetary stuffs, especially when dealing with sponsoring companies, we depend on one of our partners to become a [fiscal host](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/fiscal-hosts/fiscal-hosts) for us. There have been some discussions about the prospect of incorporating a foundation, so that the group can self-manage all money. Documenting our financials is easy for us because we track all our financial contributions and expenses online and we make our balance tracking sheets public. The hard part may be other legal/paperwork/admistrative/logistics stuff. However our group has many software developers, so there may be some possibility to automate most of it (we are still not sure whether this is a problem that is worth spending time tackling or not, but it might be really cool to have an open source foundation where everything is completely transparent, i.e. on GitHub). However there may be other factors. We’re still not sure whether to start a foundation or not, but this page is here to document the body of knowledge, factors, and requirements.

Discussions

- @dtinth: After discussing with a friend, he recommends incorporating a private company instead. There will be less ceremony involved in running the company, and expenses can be used to deduct the corporate income tax. However, the name may not be as cool, and we cannot apply for non-profit offers, since although our group is non-profit, it is not officially recognized as such.

  - @chayapatr: It would be more ideal if we can benefit from non-profit offers. e.g. [Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/nonprofits/azure)
  - @dtinth: Also for a foundation, donations are not considered taxable income as per [section 2.5 of this PDF](http://www.oic.go.th/FILEWEB/CABINFOCENTER12/DRAWER094/GENERAL/DATA0000/00000095.PDF) but again a lot of documentation involved.

- @dtinth: There seems to be a lot of [formal meetings](https://www.opsmoac.go.th/km-km_org_center-files-391991791805) and documentations involved. Can these meetings be held asynchronously or conducted on Facebook Messenger or Discord? Can [some](https://webportal.bangkok.go.th/upload/user/00000098/News/Procurement/1-64/1.pdf) of the required documentations be automated in some ways?
