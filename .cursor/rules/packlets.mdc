# Packlets Architecture

Packlets are modular feature packages that encapsulate specific functionality. They are located in [src/packlets/](mdc:src/packlets).

## Core Packlets

### Backend Packlet
[src/packlets/backend/](mdc:src/packlets/backend)
- Contains all backend code and tRPC endpoints
- **ONLY** this packlet can access MongoDB and sensitive secrets
- Frontend code MUST NOT directly import from this folder
- All frontend-backend communication goes through tRPC
- Must implement proper access controls and data filtering

### Commons Packlet
[src/packlets/commons/](mdc:src/packlets/commons)
- Shared utilities and components used across other packlets
- Common types and interfaces
- Reusable helper functions

### Layouts Packlet
[src/packlets/layouts/](mdc:src/layouts)
- Shared layout components
- Page templates and structures

## Feature Packlets

### Dashboard Packlet
[src/packlets/dashboard/](mdc:src/packlets/dashboard)
- User dashboard functionality
- Account management features

### Wiki Packlet
[src/packlets/wiki/](mdc:src/packlets/wiki)
- Wiki system implementation
- Documentation features

### Videos Packlet
[src/packlets/videos/](mdc:src/packlets/videos)
- Video management and playback features

### Markdown Packlet
[src/packlets/markdown/](mdc:src/packlets/markdown)
- Markdown processing and rendering
- Content transformation utilities

## Packlet Guidelines
- Each packlet should be self-contained with clear responsibilities
- Cross-packlet dependencies should be minimized
- Backend packlet is special - other packlets must use tRPC to communicate with it
- Follow the same code style and best practices as the rest of the project
